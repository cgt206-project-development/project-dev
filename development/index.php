			<h3>History</h3>
			<p class="fifty-fifty">
				The League of United Latin American Citizens has a long history. It begins with the annexation of a third of Mexico’s territory following the Mexican War, which resulted in nearly 77,000 Mexicans becoming United States citizens. For generations, these citizens were to be plagued by prejudice that would result in overt acts of discrimination and segregation. This prejudice led to the curtailment of many civil rights.
			</p>
			<p class="fifty-fifty">
				In Texas, prejudice and acts of discrimination had reached such extreme proportions that Mexican Americans began organizing to defend themselves. There were three main organizations: The Order of the Sons of America, the Knights of America in San Antonio, and The League of Latin American Citizens.  All three organizations worked hard to merge and form the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) in 1929. 

			<p class="fifty-fifty">
				Today the League of United Latin American Citizens is the oldest and most widely respected Hispanic civil rights organization in the United States. The founders of LULAC created an organization that empowers its members to create and develop opportunities where they are needed most. Learn more about the history of LULAC here: http://lulac.org/about/history/
			</p>
			<p class="fifty-fifty">
				Annually, LULAC engages its network of 135,000 community volunteers, 1,000 local councils, 60 community technology centers and 14 LULAC National Educational Service Centers to empower Latino families through direct service programs and advocacy in 35 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Southwest Washington LULAC Council 47013, founded in August 2011 in Vancouver, Wa, is one of 1,000 local councils made up of volunteer community leaders. As a council in good standing, we have access to other councils, National programs, technology centers, and LULAC National Educational Service Centers.
